# exercises
How to complete the exercises:

1. Open the file 'Exercises.js'
2. Respond to the prompts for each topic with your own code in the area marked YOUR CODE HERE
3. open 'Exercises.html' in chrome to load the webpage where you can check your results

Other information:

After you've completed your exercises and want to reset it for another run, open ExercisesTemplate.js
and copy the entire file(cmd+a,cmd+c), then paste it in place of the text currently in Exercises.js
(cmd+a,cmd+v)

If you want to randomly select a couple exercises to do instead of doing all of them each time, open
'Selector.html' in chrome and it will generate 5 random exercises for you.
Want more or less than 5?
Provide an argument to 'selectExercises()' and it will generate however many you tell it to!

If you're stuck, there's a file named Solutions.js that contains one solution for each exercise
